## Test the application 
### POST request
Open a new terminal window. Run the following command to POST the receipt

```bash
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
    "retailer": "Target",
    "purchaseDate": "2022-01-01",
    "purchaseTime": "13:01",
    "items": [
    {
      "shortDescription": "Mountain Dew 12PK",
      "price": "6.49"
    },{
      "shortDescription": "Emils Cheese Pizza",
      "price": "12.25"
    }],
     "total": "35.35"
    }' http://localhost:8080/receipts/process
```
Example Response:
```json
{ "id": "1880b0d3-ddf5-4370-9537-d86c88c2d201" }
```
---
### GET request
Run the following command to get the points for a receipt by specifying id obtained from the post request

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/receipts/1880b0d3-ddf5-4370-9537-d86c88c2d201/points
```
Example Response:
```json
{ "points": 20 }
```

### Test application using Postman

If Postman is installed in your system 

1. Import the FetchRewards.postman_collection.json file to your postman. The json file is present in the repository. 
2. Run the post service i.e. http://localhost:8080/receipts/process. This will store the receipt in-memory and generate an id for it as response.
3. Pass this generated id as a path variable {id} in the GET request i.e. http://localhost:8080/receipts/{id}/points. This will calculate the points awarded for the receipt. 

## Summary of API Specification

### Endpoint: Process Receipts

* Path: `/receipts/process`
* Method: `POST`
* Payload: Receipt JSON
* Response: JSON containing an id for the receipt.

Description:

Takes in a JSON receipt (see example in the example directory) and returns a JSON object with an ID generated by your code.

The ID returned is the ID that should be passed into `/receipts/{id}/points` to get the number of points the receipt
was awarded.

How many points should be earned are defined by the rules below.

Reminder: Data does not need to survive an application restart. This is to allow you to use in-memory solutions to track any data generated by this endpoint.

Example Response:
```json
{ "id": "1880b0d3-ddf5-4370-9537-d86c88c2d201" }
```

## Endpoint: Get Points

* Path: `/receipts/{id}/points`
* Method: `GET`
* Response: A JSON object containing the number of points awarded.

A simple Getter endpoint that looks up the receipt by the ID and returns an object specifying the points awarded.

Example Response:
```json
{ "points": 32 }
```

# Rules

These rules collectively define how many points should be awarded to a receipt.

* One point for every alphanumeric character in the retailer name.
* 50 points if the total is a round dollar amount with no cents.
* 25 points if the total is a multiple of `0.25`.
* 5 points for every two items on the receipt.
* If the trimmed length of the item description is a multiple of 3, multiply the price by `0.2` and round up to the nearest integer. The result is the number of points earned.
* 6 points if the day in the purchase date is odd.
* 10 points if the time of purchase is after 2:00pm and before 4:00pm.
